# 🚦 AI Traffic Control System

An intelligent traffic management system powered by computer vision and machine learning. This project automates traffic signal control using real-time vehicle detection from surveillance footage, helping to reduce congestion and optimize signal timings dynamically.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Real-time vehicle detection using OpenCV and machine learning
- 🧠 Dynamic signal control based on traffic density
- 📊 Visualization of traffic flow and decision logic
- 📷 Camera input support (live feed or pre-recorded video)
- 🛠️ Modular, extendable architecture for future enhancements (e.g., emergency vehicle detection)

## 🖼️ Demo

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Pre-trained ML models for object detection (YOLO / Haar cascades, depending on your implementation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
